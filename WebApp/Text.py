Whats the meaninig of VFCP? VFCP stands for "Vehicle Fuel Consumption Predictor". this is a Machine Learning Model that predict the rate of fuel consumtion and CO2 emission of a vehcile with respect to it's some characteristics like "Engine Size", "Number of Cylinders", "Fuel Type" and ... . Detialed informations of the project are explained in references. Are you excited? Let's use the model!
